# Jointed Hand

I wanted to make a moving hand with bones, ligaments, and tendons. This repo
contains all the models for each of the bones. Assembly into the full model
requires rubber (I'm using inner tube rubber from a bike wheel), superglue
(cyanoacrylate), string, and patience.

Original bone models from: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15342

The models in this repo are hand adjusted to make pockets for inserting the
rubber
